- **Stealth Camera Capture**  
  ➤ Automatically captures photo/video when unauthorized access or CMD/PowerShell is attempted

- **Malicious Behavior Quarantine Engine**  
  ➤ AI-based detection of code patterns triggers isolation before damage occurs

- **User ID Obfuscation**  
  ➤ Prevents predictable user ID enumeration and internal privilege escalation

- **Fake Data Trap & Lookup Decoys**  
  ➤ Deceives intruders with believable, false targets and logs attacker behavior
